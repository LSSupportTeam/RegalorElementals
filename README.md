# ‚ú® Regalor Elementals - Minecraft Power Plugin ‚ú®

Welcome to Regalor Elementals! This Spigot/Paper plugin allows server administrators to create unique elemental powers, represented by custom items, that grant players special abilities upon use. Players receive a random power upon joining or can obtain their assigned power via a command.

## üöÄ Features

* ‚ú® **Highly Customizable Powers:** Define unique abilities with effects, projectiles, flight, and more via simple YAML files. No coding needed!
* üíé **Custom Items:** Control the name, material, lore, and even CustomModelData of power items.
* ‚è≥ **Cooldown System:** Prevent ability spam with configurable cooldowns shown on a Boss Bar.
* ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π **Resource Costs:** Optionally require XP levels or player health to use abilities.
* üîä **Effects & Sounds:** Add particle effects and sounds for ability activation feedback.
* üé≤ **Random Assignment:** Players get a random power using `/rsobtain` if they don't have one.
* üõ°Ô∏è **Item Protection:** Power items are protected from dropping, being placed, moved into chests/armor slots, or lost on death (returns on respawn). Prevents duplication.

3.  Place the `.jar` file into your server's `plugins/` directory.
4.  Start your server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`config.yml`)

This is the main configuration file located in `plugins/RegalorElementals/config.yml`.

* `debug-mode: <true|false>`
    * Set to `true` to enable detailed console logs for troubleshooting power loading and usage. Recommended to keep `false` during normal operation.
    ```yaml
    debug-mode: false
    ```
* `registered-powers: [list]`
    * A list of the **filenames** (without `.yml`) of the powers you want the plugin to load from the `powers/` folder. The plugin will only recognize powers listed here.
    ```yaml
    registered-powers:
      - "infernos"
      - "aerol"
      - "shield"
      - "stormbringer"
      # Add more power file names here
    ```
* `received-powers: {map}`
    * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not manually edit this section!**
    * The plugin uses this section to store which power has been assigned to each player's UUID.
* **Inventory Full Messages** (`messages:` section within `config.yml`)
    * Customize the title/subtitle shown when a player tries to obtain an item but their inventory is full.
    ```yaml
    messages:
      inventory-full-title: "&cInventory Full!"
      inventory-full-subtitle: "&eClear space to receive item!"
    ```

## ü™Ñ Creating Custom Powers (`powers/` folder)

This is the core of the plugin! Each unique power is defined by its own `.yml` file inside `plugins/RegalorElementals/powers/`. For example, a power named "Infernos" would be configured in `plugins/RegalorElementals/powers/infernos.yml`, and you must add `"infernos"` to the `registered-powers` list in `config.yml`.

Here's a breakdown of all available options within a power's `.yml` file:

<details>
<summary><strong>üè∑Ô∏è Item Configuration</strong></summary>

> _Defines how the power item looks in-game._

* **`display-name: "<name>"`**
    * The item's name. Use `&` for [Minecraft color codes](https://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php).
    ```yaml
    display-name: "&6&lInfernos"
    ```
* **`material: <MATERIAL_NAME>`**
    * The item's type. Use standard [Bukkit Material names](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html).
    ```yaml
    material: NETHER_STAR
    ```
* **`custom-model-data: <number>`** (Optional)
    * Sets the `CustomModelData` NBT tag for use with resource packs. Defaults to `0`.
    ```yaml
    custom-model-data: 1001
    ```
* **`lore: [list]`**
    * A list of strings representing the item's description lines below the name. Use `&` for colors. Placeholders like `%cooldown%` can sometimes be used here, but they won't update dynamically.
    ```yaml
    lore:
      - "&eHarness the power of the nether."
      - "&7Right-click to unleash a fireball!"
      - ""
      - "&cCooldown: 5 seconds" # Example static text
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Gameplay Configuration</strong></summary>

> _Controls the power's mechanics._

* **`spawn-chance: <number>`**
    * Determines the likelihood of this power being assigned randomly via `/rsobtain`. Higher numbers mean a higher chance relative to other powers. Set to `0` to disable random assignment.
    ```yaml
    spawn-chance: 3
    ```
* **`cooldown: <seconds>`**
    * The time in seconds a player must wait after using the ability before they can use it again. Set to `0` for no cooldown.
    ```yaml
    cooldown: 5
    ```
* **`post-flight-cooldown: <seconds>`**
    * **Only applicable if `ability.type` is `flight`**. This is the cooldown *after* the flight duration ends before the player can activate the flight ability again.
    ```yaml
    post-flight-cooldown: 10
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Resource Costs</strong></summary>

> _Optionally make abilities consume resources._

* **`use-xp-cost: <true|false>`**
    * Set to `true` to require the player to have a certain number of XP levels. Default: `false`.
    ```yaml
    use-xp-cost: true
    ```
* **`xp-cost-levels: <number>`**
    * The number of XP *levels* deducted if `use-xp-cost` is `true`. Default: `1`.
    ```yaml
    xp-cost-levels: 1
    ```
* **`use-health-cost: <true|false>`**
    * Set to `true` to require the player to sacrifice health. Default: `false`.
    ```yaml
    use-health-cost: true
    ```
* **`health-cost: <half-hearts>`**
    * The amount of health (in half-hearts) deducted if `use-health-cost` is `true`. `2.0` equals one full heart. The plugin prevents fatal damage from this cost. Default: `2.0`.
    ```yaml
    health-cost: 4.0 # Costs 2 hearts
    ```

    * Leave empty `""` otherwise.
